### Nested Schema for `proxy`

Optional:

- `from_env` (Boolean) When `true` the provider will discover the proxy configuration from environment variables. This is based upon [`http.ProxyFromEnvironment`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ProxyFromEnvironment) and it supports the same environment variables (default: `true`).
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password used for Basic authentication against the Proxy.
- `url` (String) URL used to connect to the Proxy. Accepted schemes are: `http`, `https`, `socks5`.
- `username` (String) Username (or Token) used for Basic authentication against the Proxy.
